## Even Fibonacci Numbers

Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## FizzBuff

```gherkin
Given an integer n, for every positive integer i <= n, the task is to print,

“FizzBuzz” if i is divisible by 3 and 5,
“Fizz” if i is divisible by 3,
“Buzz” if i is divisible by 5
“i” as a string, if none of the conditions are true.
```

Apply the following System prompt:

```bash
@FizzBuff.java Improve the class/classes added in the context applying the system prompt @142-java-functional-programming@142-java-functional-programming.md
